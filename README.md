# My first webGL experience
Here is my homework in three.js, I chose to create a black hole.

# To run it you must 
In your terminal write down `npm install` to install the packages and `npm run dev` to run the localserver

## Features
 - You can move your cursor to change the POV
 - Dat.gui for positions and speed animation

## Features needed
 - Customize your black hole or stars
 - More controls for dat.gui
 - Add another black hole

### I Hope you will enjoy
